# Full-UVM-Verification-Environment-for-16x32-Memory
This is a UVM-based verification environment to verify the functionality of a 16x32 memory module. This memory module has 16 addressable locations, each with 32-bit wide data. The verification environment will consist of several key components: a testbench top module, UVM components (agents, sequences, and drivers), and supporting utilities.
